Final Project Proposal
16 November 2021


Proposal:
Data: Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.  Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 variables that can be used to predict  possible heart disease. Machine learning model can be useful in predicting which of these variables contribute to heart failure.
Potential methods: Classification using
	Bootstrapping (to simulate larger data sets)
	Bagging/Boosting
	SVM
	validation with confusion matrix and cross validation
Questions: 1. Can we identify one (or more) symptoms (or symptoms families) that are strong indicators of heart failure?
	2. Can we identify a method that performs most efficiently
